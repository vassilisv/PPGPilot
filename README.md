## TODO

- Use forecast wind direction and speed before takeoff
- Add options (desired flight duration etc)
- Use sunset to cap flight duration if flying in evenings
- Display map (swipe)
- Display additional fields (swipe), time to sundown, air speed, estimated speed to home, wind estimation bins, time of day
